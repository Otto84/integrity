## ``` Integrity - a decentralized storage trough IPFS ```


## ðŸ”§ Project :
Is service like a cloud storage but decentralized

Here i did prepare a contract that use IPFS for storage in a hashing some files,
like a decentralized Cloud.
the frontend is in react

I did also make an nft token but i did big problem with the frontend and i could not present it. I did work also on the standard erc20.

I did think to the words of Cogan that said "don't warry about the project it will be your first one not the best and bigger of your life"

the Dapp now is settled for work with Ganache GUI on the port 7545, then truffle migrate, than npm run start

please think also to this
The real project is more big that this little thing,
I'm very interested in the NFT token, and i originally plaining to create
a project in that direction.
I think that there are a lot of possibilities with nft and real art or real
prestigious handmade.

I did plaining to build a platform for mint nft, auction for them, and create a special art gallery where the artist/owner that stake their nft can claim a token.

Unfortunately with the start of the lockdown in italy, where i live, the business of my parents took a hard hit, and almost all my time it was blowed
from help them at work.
